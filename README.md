In my professional realm, I am an electrical engineer with expertise in Python, Arduino,
PCB designing, and computer networking, among other areas. You can categorize me as a computer
sciences enthusiast who revels in understanding the intricacies of systems, creating solutions,
uncovering vulnerabilities, and building things that push the boundaries. 😄 
Outside of work, I indulge in my passion for gaming, cinematography, and reading novels.
